# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Svelte Table. It's people like you that make it such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

# Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. 

# Your First Contribution
> Unsure where to begin contributing to the repo? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
* Remember running tests (or adding new ones that are neccessary) - npm test

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.


> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
> When filing an issue, please use this template:
>
> 1. What version of TypeScript, Svelte and @hurtigruten/svelte-table are you using?
> 2. What did you do?
> 3. What did you expect to see?
> 4. What did you see instead?
> 5. Include a code snippet using [Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/): 

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Svelte Talbe, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code, commit message and labeling conventions
> We use eslint, remember to npm install packages to get it working
> Please consider using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
